                <h3>About Me!</h3>
                <p class="fade-in">Hello! I'm Javed Akhatar, a passionate programmer currently studying at Integral University in Lucknow. I embarked on my coding journey because of my fascination with how technology shapes our lives. I'm building a solid foundation in Java, MySQL, JavaScript, C, HTML, and CSS.</p>
                <p class="fade-in">Recently, I completed a 43-day intensive internship at Techwizer IT Solutions, where I focused on backend development. During this time, I gained hands-on experience in designing, developing, and maintaining server-side applications and databases. I developed and implemented RESTful APIs for various applications, ensuring efficient and scalable data handling while also implementing security measures to safeguard applications and data. Collaborating with team members on project tasks allowed me to contribute to code reviews and collaborative development, which enhanced my teamwork skills.</p>
                <p class="fade-in">I possess strong soft skills that complement my technical abilities, including adaptability, collaboration, work ethic, problem-solving, and effective communication. I thrive under pressure and enjoy troubleshooting challenges.</p>
                <p class="fade-in">As I continue my journey in tech, my goal is to develop applications that address real-world problems. I'm eager to learn and explore new technologies, and I look forward to taking on more challenges that help me grow as a developer.</p>
                <p class="fade-in">Outside of programming, I enjoy exploring new techs, engaging in group discussions, playing football and badminton, participating in e-sports, and reading novels. These activities help me maintain a balanced lifestyle and fuel my creativity.</p>
